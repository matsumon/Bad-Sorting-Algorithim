data.txt needs to be in the same folder as badSort.py and badSortTime.py in order to work.
In order to run badSort.py
	run python3 badSort.py alpha in the terminal.
	Ex) python3 badSort.py 2/3
This will output the results to bad.out
In order to run badSortTime.py	
	run python3 badSortTime.py in the terminal.
